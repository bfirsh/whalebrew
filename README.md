# Whalebrew

Whalebrew creates aliases for Docker images so you can run them as if they were native commands. It's like Homebrew, but with Docker images.

Docker works well for packaging up development environments, but there are lots of tools that aren't tied to a particular project: `awscli` for managing your AWS account, `ffmpeg` for converting video, `wget` for downloading files, and so on. Whalebrew makes those things work with Docker, too.

Whalebrew can run almost any CLI tool, but it isn't for everything (e.g. where commands must start instantly). It works particularly well for:

* **Complex dependencies.** For example, a Python app that requires C libraries, specific package versions, and other CLI tools that you don't want to clutter up your machine with.
* **Cross-platform portability.** Package managers tend to be very closely tied to the system they are running on. Whalebrew packages work on any modern version of macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Install

First, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/). The easiest way to do this on macOS is by installing [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/).

Next, on macOS and Linux:

    curl -L "https://github.com/bfirsh/whalebrew/releases/download/0.1.0/whalebrew-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/whalebrew; chmod +x /usr/local/bin/whalebrew

on Windows with Command Prompt:

    @"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser Bypass; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bfirsh/whalebrew/0.0.5/install.ps1'))" && SET "WHALEBREW_INSTALL_PATH=C:\whalebrew" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%WHALEBREW_INSTALL_PATH%"

on Windows with Powershell:

    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser AllSigned; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bfirsh/whalebrew/0.0.5/install.ps1'))

## Usage

### Install packages

    $ whalebrew install whalebrew/wget

This will install the image `whalebrew/wget` as `/usr/local/bin/wget`.

The images in the `whalebrew` organization are a set of images that are known to work well with Whalebrew. You can also install any other images on Docker Hub too, but they may not work well:

    $ whalebrew install bfirsh/ffmpeg

### Find packages

    $ whalebrew search
    whalebrew/ack
    whalebrew/awscli
    whalebrew/docker-cloud
    whalebrew/ffmpeg
    whalebrew/gnupg
    ...

    $ whalebrew search wget
    whalebrew/wget

### List installed packages

    $ whalebrew list
    COMMAND     IMAGE
    ffmpeg      bfirsh/ffmpeg
    wget        whalebrew/wget
    whalebrew   whalebrew/whalebrew
    whalesay    whalebrew/whalesay

### Uninstall packages

    $ whalebrew uninstall wget

### Upgrade packages

To upgrade a single package, just pull its image:

    $ docker pull whalebrew/wget

## Configuration

Whalebrew is configured with environment variables, which you can either provide at runtime or put in your `~/.bashrc` file (or whatever shell you use).

 - `WHALEBREW_INSTALL_PATH`: The directory to install packages in. (default for macOS and Linux: `/usr/local/bin`, default for Windows: `C:\whalebrew`)

## How it works

Whalebrew is simple, and leans as much as possible on native Docker features:

* Packages are installed as files in `/usr/local/bin` (or a directory that you configure) with a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) to make them executable. The content of the file is YAML that describes the options to pass to `docker run`, similar to a Compose service. For example:

        #!/usr/bin/env whalebrew
        image: whalebrew/whalesay

* When a package is executed, Whalebrew will run the specified image with Docker, mount the current working directory in `/workdir`, and pass through all of the arguments.

  To understand what it is doing, you can imagine it as a shell script that looks something like this:

      docker run -it -v "$(pwd)":/workdir -w /workdir $IMAGE "$@"

## Creating packages

Packages are Docker images published on Docker Hub. The requirements to make them work are:

* They must have the command to be run set as the entrypoint.
* They must only work with files in `/workdir`.

That's it. So long as your image is set up to work that way, it'll work with Whalebrew.

### Configuration

There are some labels you can use to configure how Whalebrew installs your image:

* `io.whalebrew.name`: The name to give the command. Defaults to the name of the image.
* `io.whalebrew.config.environment`: A list of environment variables to pass into the image from the current environment when the command is run. For example, putting this in your `Dockerfile` will pass through the values of `TERM` and `FOOBAR_NAME` in your shell when the command is run:

        LABEL io.whalebrew.config.environment '["TERM", "FOOBAR_NAME"]'

* `io.whalebrew.config.volumes`: A list of volumes to mount when the command is run. For example, putting this in your image's `Dockerfile` will mount `~/.docker` as `/root/.docker` in read-only mode:

        LABEL io.whalebrew.config.volumes '["~/.docker:/root/.docker:ro"]'

* `io.whalebrew.config.ports`: A list of host port to container port mappings to create when the command is run. For example, putting this in your image's `Dockerfile` will map container port 8100 to host port 8100:

        LABEL io.whalebrew.config.ports '["8100:8100"]'

* `io.whalebrew.config.networks`: A list of networks to connect on the container.

        LABEL io.whalebrew.config.networks '["host"]'

* `io.whalebrew.config.working_dir`: The path the working directory should be bound to in the container. For example putting this in your image's `Dockerfile` will ensure the working directory is available in /working_directory in the container

        LABEL io.whalebrew.config.working_dir '/working_directory'

#### Using user environment variables

The labels `io.whalebrew.config.working_dir`, `io.whalebrew.config.volumes` and `io.whalebrew.config.environment` are expanded with user environment variables when the container is launched.

For example, if your image has this line in your `Dockerfile`:

        LABEL io.whalebrew.config.working_dir '$PWD'

At runtime, it will bind your working directory into the container at the same path and set it as the working directory.


### Whalebrew images

We maintain a set of packages which are known to follow these requirements under the `whalebrew` organization on [GitHub](https://github.com/whalebrew) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/whalebrew/). If you want to add a package to this, open a pull request against [whalebrew-packages](https://github.com/whalebrew/whalebrew-packages).

## Thanks

* Justin Cormack for [the original idea](https://github.com/justincormack/dockercommand-cli) and generally just being very clever.
